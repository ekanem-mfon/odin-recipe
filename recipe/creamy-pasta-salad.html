    <h1>Shrimp Pasta Salad</h1>
    <img src="../images/pasta.jpeg">

    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    Very light flavor and low in calories.
    Originally meant to be a side dish I made some healthy substitutions and added shrimp.
    I usually serve with asparagus, the entire family loves it.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <strong>Dressing:</strong>
        <li>¼ cup Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <br>

        <strong>Pasta:</strong>
        <li>10 ounces penne pasta</li>
        <li>40 medium shrimp, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped scallions (green onions)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ lemon, thinly sliced</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Whisk yogurt, chicken broth, lemon juice, 
            Dijon mustard, garlic, 
            and 1 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; 
            add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. 
            Drain and rinse under cold water until pasta is slightly cooled.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Toss shrimp and 2 tablespoons olive oil together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. 
            Transfer to a glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp are bright pink and cooked through, 
            10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Toss pasta with dressing in a bowl. Add shrimp and scallions; 
            season with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and more pepper.
